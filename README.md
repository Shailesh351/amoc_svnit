# amoc_svnit
This is AMOC project built  by me


This is first part of  android app for patient  for dispensary @SVNIT.
through this app patient can register 
and by login can see his/her profile ,edit profile.
can check medical history (symptoses,medicines prescribes etc which is given by doctor app)

There are validation using TextInputEditText
Navigation Drawer for quick access,
Stay login action using SharedPrefference.

In this app I have used only two activities(homeScreenPatient and registerAsPatient) remainings are fragments.

By clicking NavigationDrawer menus i have started new Fragment.

Using SwipeRefreshLayout you can refresh fragments easily
